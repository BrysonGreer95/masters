      <p>
The Ultimate Master’s Competition is our way of adding an extra layer of fun to the already exciting week of the Master’s! We hope that you’ll join us in a multi- event competition, focused around various aspects of the game of golf and a celebration on Sunday. The competition will consist of 3 events, each focused on a different skill set. Each event has an opportunity to earn points. The competitor with the most points at the end of the competition on Sunday will win the grand prize of a new putter! We look forward to you joining us.
(P.S. if you can’t make all events, no worries! We hope to see you whenever you’re able to join us.)
Before the Competition:
Each competitor will choose one golfer to win the official Master’s tournament (by texting Bryson) before Thursday, April 11th. This locks in your “bet” which will bring points in on Day 3, Sunday.
Buy in:
The buy in per competitor is $25. This enters you in the competition to win the putter, and covers your food cost for the party Sunday.
Prize:
The prize will most likely be a new Odyssey White Hot mallet putter. This of course depends on our pool of money from the collected buy in (as mentioned above).
